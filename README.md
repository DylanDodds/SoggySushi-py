# SoggySushi-py
The Sassiest Discord Bot, there ever was.
Application in Progress

## Notice
I have a key.py file in a local directory so I do not include my private key with pushes to github. I recommend that you do the same. The application will not run until you remove the import key and key.auth_key related content in main.py.

This application is built on discord.py Python API, which includes dependencies not listed on this page at the current time.
You can find the installation and dependency instructions on the github page for discord.py.
